# Full Coverage Audit Remediation Log

- Workflow: `altibase-gpt-full-coverage-audit`
- Initialized by: `FCA-J003`
- Status: Active log for later FCA remediation jobs

## Log Contract

Every later job that changes attachments, GPT instructions, support reports, catalog
rows, matrix rows, or registers should add a concise entry here.

Each entry should include:

- job ID;
- changed files;
- affected `source_item_id` values or register entries;
- source evidence;
- coverage status changes;
- validation commands and results;
- skipped checks or residual risk.

## Entries

### FCA-J003

- Changed files: initialized full coverage audit schema, TSV headers, registers, final
  report placeholder, and reusable script tooling under
  `GPTs/reports/full_coverage_audit/`.
- Product coverage changes: none. This job does not catalog source items or remediate
  customer-facing attachments.
- Evidence: `AGENTS.md`, `source_corpus_lock.md`, `coverage_matrix.md`,
  `source_inventory.md`, `gap_register.md`, `catalog_schema_extraction_rules.md`, and
  latest locked benchmark artifacts under
  `evals/altibase_answerability/reports/full_benchmark/runs/altibase_answerability_20260517_205641/`.
- Validation: `python3 GPTs/reports/full_coverage_audit/scripts/fca_catalog_tools.py check --require-registers`
  passed with 0 catalog rows and 0 matrix rows; `git diff --check` passed;
  `bash review/scripts/run_review_stage.sh validate` passed with 20 upload attachments;
  `rg -n "^Verdict:|^\| (Blocker|High|Medium|Low) \|" review/reports/R*.md` showed
  `Verdict: Pass` for R00-R27 and no actionable severity rows.
- Residual risk: item-level catalog rows, matrix rows, and final dispositions remain
  assigned to later FCA jobs.

### FCA-J004

- Changed files: `source_item_catalog.tsv`, `missing_item_register.md`, `guardrail_register.md`, `retrieval_weakness_register.md`, and this remediation log.
- Product coverage changes: cataloged release/platform/patch source rows only; no customer-facing attachment text was changed and no original source documents were edited.
- Catalog totals added by this job: 165 rows total; 16 `Covered`, 15 `Covered-by-routing`, 128 `Missing`, 5 `Guardrail`, 1 `Out-of-scope`, and 0 `Retrieval-weak`.
- Source evidence: Korean Altibase 7.1/7.3/8.1 release notes, Korean `Technical Documents/kor/Supported Platforms.md`, and selected Korean 7.1/7.3 patch notes under `PatchNotes/Altibase_7.1/kor` and `PatchNotes/Altibase_7.3/kor`.
- Coverage status changes: exact release/platform rows already represented in `00_version_release_platform.md` were marked `Covered` or `Covered-by-routing`; exact patch-note change-set rows and older tool-release boundaries absent from answer-ready attachments were registered as `Missing`; unlisted platform support, release-note-only procedure scope, Shard/Windows2026 release notes without a selected owner, and 6.5.1 platform rows were registered as guardrail or out-of-scope rows.
- Validation: `python3 GPTs/reports/full_coverage_audit/scripts/fca_catalog_tools.py check --require-registers` passed with 165 catalog rows and 0 matrix rows; ASCII hygiene scan passed; `git diff --check` passed; `bash review/scripts/run_review_stage.sh validate` passed with 20 upload attachments; review-report severity scan showed `Verdict: Pass` for R00-R27 and no actionable severity rows.
- Residual risk: patch notes are cataloged at patch-file change-set granularity with all `BUG-*` tokens preserved in `literal_tokens`; later matrix/remediation work may split high-priority patch files into per-BUG rows before closing exact patch answerability gaps.
